= Music Library

Simple searchable music library made with Sinatra and Datamapper

== Configuration

Dependencies and all configuration is done in <tt>init.rb</tt>. Your database is also set up here. DataMapper will use sqlite3 by default. Tests use the sqlite3-memory adapter (no configuration needed).


== Getting Started

  rake db:migrate
  shotgun music.rb
